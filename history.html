      <h3>The History of Los Angeles</h3>
      <p>Los Angeles was founded in 1781 and after the Mexican War of Independence, Los Angeles became a part of Mexico in 1821 before California was purchased by the United States following the Mexican-American War. In 1848, the Gold Rush encouraged many to move to California from all over the world in search of gold, although the Gold Rush mainly took place in northern California, the growing population of the state depended on the food produced by farms in southern California, specifically those in the Los Angeles Area. Los Angeles began rapidly developing after the Southern Pacific Railroad’s track to Los Angeles was completed and oil was discovered near the city. The discovery of oil in the greater Los Angeles area and the growth of the film industry in the early 20th century contributed to Los Angeles quickly becoming a major city in the United States with a population of over 1 million in 1924. Los Angeles is now the second largest city in the United States with the a population of 18.5 million in the greater Los Angeles area. Los Angeles’ entertainment industry is still among the most prominent in the world and continues to be a popular destination for people seeking a career in entertainment to move to and for tourists to travel to to see the iconic landmarks of the city.</p>
