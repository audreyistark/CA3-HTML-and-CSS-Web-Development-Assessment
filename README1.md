Design Report

For this website's navigation I used a horizontal navigation bar at the top of the screen below the banner containing the title of each page of the website with each button on the navigation bar linking the user to the corresponding page of the website.
This way it is easy for users to navigate between the home, history, and visit pages of the website because the navigation bar will always be at the top of the page, whether being looked at on a mobile phone, tablet or computer.

The layout of this website is quite minimalistic in order to make the information and images on each page easy to view without having lots of elements crowding a page which could potentially make it difficult for the user to view.
It was important to create a layout that could showcase images as well as text in an organized layout that was still visually appealing.
For example, instead of having long portions of text all in the same section of the visit page, I chose to use modals in order to hide certain information until the user clicks a button beneath the photos on this page to view the corresponding information.
Implementing bootstrap features like this was very useful as it allowed for a simple yet effective layout.
It was also important for the layout to look cohesive across different devices which is where the use of bootstrap elements was again very important so that the website would have a fairly similar layout on all devices while still being easy to navigate.

For this website I chose to use very few colors for the website elements other than the images in order to create a cohesive theme across the index, home, history, and visit pages.
To pick the colours I used an image editor to chose colors that were in or similar to those of the background image of the banner at the top of each page so that the colors felt similar to those of the banner image, creating a coordinated look between pages.

A challenge I faced was designing the layout of each page so that each page would feel similar to that of the other pages but not be an exact replica of the previous page's layout while also ensuring that each page would adapt well to being viewed on different types of devices and how to make that possible using various bootstrap features.
